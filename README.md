# DIT FFT 8 point

## Description
This project implements the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) method for an 8-point FFT, developed in Verilog. The goal is to demonstrate how to implement the FFT algorithm in digital hardware, providing a learning for digital signal processing.
## Objectives
- Demonstrate FFT Algorithm: Illustrate the computation of FFT through data decomposition and butterfly operations.
- Educational Reference: Serve as a guide for those learning digital circuit design and Verilog programming.
